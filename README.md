# YoutubeClientTryout
Jetpack compose based simple youtube client for searching and viewing videos. 

You will need Google Cloud API Key in order to use it. You can find out how to do it [here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/quickstart/android).

In order to use it, create your own `gradle.properties` file and put your API Key to "YOUTUBE_API_KEY" variable there. 
You can use `gradle.properties.example` as an, you know, example. :)
